# Air-Quality-Data-Exploration
Overview
This project involves analyzing a modified air quality dataset, containing 9358 instances of hourly-averaged responses from five metal-oxide chemical sensors. The data was collected from a significantly polluted area at road level in an Italian city, spanning from March 2004 to February 2005.
Objectives
The project aims to explore and analyze the air quality data, addressing the challenges posed by sensor cross-sensitivities and drifts, and to provide insights into the pollution levels in the monitored area.
